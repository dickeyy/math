# Math

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/dickeyy/math/graph/badge.svg?token=1h8hyO80Dk)](https://codecov.io/gh/dickeyy/math)

For educational purposes, I am trying to implement some of the functions in Go's `math` package.

The purpose of this is NOT to replace Go's package, but rather to get a better understanding of how some of the functions work.
